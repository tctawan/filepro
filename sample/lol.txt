<p>
Given the expansive growth in the field, it's become challenging to discern
what belongs in a modern computer science degree.
</p>

<p> My own faculty is engaging in this debate, so I've coalesced my
thoughts as an answer to the question, "What should every computer science
major know?" </p>

<p>
I've tried to answer this question as
the conjunction of four concerns:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>What should every student know to get a good job?</li>

 <li>What should every student know to maintain lifelong employment?</li>

 <li>What should every student know to enter graduate school?</li>

 <li>What should every student know to benefit society?</li>
</ul>

<p> My thoughts below factor into both general principles and specific
recommendations relevant to the modern computing landscape.  </p>

<p>
Computer science majors: feel free to use this as a self-study guide.
</p>

<p>
Please email or 
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/mattmight">tweet</a> with suggestions 
for addition and deletion.
</p>

<p>
<b>Update</b>: Thanks for the suggestions and reminders! 
I'll incorporate them as I receive them to keep this a living document.

<h2>Portfolio versus resume</h2>

<p> Having emerged from engineering and mathematics, computer science programs
take a resume-based approach to hiring off their graduates.</p>

<p>
A <em>resume</em> says nothing of a programmer's ability.
</p>

<p>
Every computer science major should build a <em>portfolio</em>.
</p>

<p> A portfolio could be as simple as a personal blog, with a post for each
project or accomplishment.  

 A better portfolio would include per-project pages,
and publicly browsable code (hosted perhaps on github or Google code). </p>

<p>
Contributions to open source should be linked and documented.
</p>

<p>
A code portfolio allows employers to directly
judge ability.
</p>

<p>
GPAs and resumes do not.
</p>

<p> Professors should design course projects  to impress 
on portfolios,
and students, at the conclusion of each course, should take time to update
them.  </p>

<h2>Technical communication</h2>

<p>
Lone wolves in computer science are 
an endangered species.
</p>

<p> Modern computer scientists must practice persuasively and clearly communicating their
ideas to non-programmers.  </p>

<p> In smaller companies, whether or not a programmer can
communicate her ideas to management may make the difference between the
company's success and failure.  </p>

<p> Unfortunately, this is not something fixed with the addition of a single
class (although a solid course in technical communication doesn't hurt).  </p>

<p> More classes need to provide students the opportunity to present their work
and defend their ideas with oral presentations.  </p>

<h3>Specific recommendations</h3>

<p> I would recommend that students master a presentation tool like
PowerPoint or (my favorite) Keynote. 
(Sorry, as much as I love them, LaTeX-based presentation tools are just too static.)</p>

<p>
For producing beautiful mathematical documentation, LaTeX has no equal.

All written assignments in technical courses should be submitted in LaTeX.
</p>

<h2>An engineering core</h2>

<p>
Computer science is not quite engineering.
</p>

<p>
But, it's close enough.
</p>

<p> Computer scientists <em>will</em> find themselves working with engineers.
 </p>

<p> Computer scientists and traditional engineers need to speak the same
language--a language rooted in real analysis, linear algebra, probability and
physics.  </p>

<p>
Computer scientists ought to take physics through electromagnetism.

But, to do that, they'll need take up through multivariate calculus,
(and differential equations for good measure).  </p>

<p> In constructing sound simulations, a command of probability and (often
times) linear algebra is invaluable. 
In interpreting results, there is no
substitute for a solid understanding of statistics.</p>

<h2>The Unix philosophy</h2>


<p> Computer scientists should be comfortable with and practiced in the Unix
philosophy of computing.  </p>

<p> The Unix philosophy (as opposed to Unix itself) is one that emphasizes
linguistic abstraction and composition in order to effect computation.  </p>

<p> In practice, this means becoming comfortable with the notion of
command-line computing, text-file configuration and IDE-less software
development.  </p>



<h3>Specific recommendations</h3>

<p>
Given the prevalence of Unix systems,
computer scientists today should be fluent in basic Unix, including the ability to:
</p>

<ul>
  
  <li>navigate 
  and manipulate the filesystem;
  </li>

  <li>
  compose processes with pipes;
  </li>

  <li>
  comfortably edit a file with <code>emacs</code>
  <em>and</em> <code>vim</code>;
  </li>

  <li>
  create, modify and execute a Makefile for a software project;
  </li>

  <li>
  write simple shell scripts.
  </li>
  
</ul>





<p> Students will reject the Unix philosophy unless they understand
its power.  

 Thus, it's best to challenge students to
complete useful tasks for which Unix has a comparative advantage, such
as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Find the five folders in a given directory consuming the most space.</li>

  <li>Report duplicate MP3s (by file contents, not file name) on a computer.</li>

  <li>Take a list of names whose first and last names have been lower-cased, and properly recapitalize them.</li>

  <li>Find all words in English that have <code>x</code> as their second letter, and <code>n</code> as their second-to-last.</li>

  <li>Directly route your microphone input over the network to another computer's speaker.</li>

  <li>Replace all spaces in a filename with underscore for a given directory.</li>

  <li>Report the last ten errant accesses to the web server coming from 
  a specific IP address.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Systems administration</h2>

<p>
Some computer scientists sneer at systems administration as an "IT" task.
</p>

<p>
The thinking is that a computer scientist can teach herself how to do anything a technician can do.
</p>

<p>
This is true.  (In theory.)
</p>

<p> Yet this attitude is misguided: computer
scientists must be able to competently and securely administer their own
systems and networks.  </p>

<p> Many tasks in software development are most efficiently
executed without passing through a systems administrator.  </p>



<h3>Specific recommendations</h3>

<p>
Every modern computer scientist should be able to:
</p>

<ul>
 
 <li>Install and administer a Linux distribution.</li>

 <li>Configure and compile the Linux kernel.</li>

 <li>Troubleshoot a connection
   with 
   <code>dig</code>,
   <code>ping</code> and
   <code>traceroute</code>.</li>

 
 <li>Compile and configure a web server like apache.</li>

 <li>Compile and configure a DNS daemon like bind.</li>

 <li>Maintain a web site with a text editor.</li>

<h2>Programming languages</h2>

<p>
Programming languages rise and fall with the solar cycle.
</p>

<p>
A programmer's career should not.
</p>


<p>
While it is important to teach languages relevant to employers,
it is equally important that students learn how to teach themselves
new languages.
</p>


<p>
The best way to learn how to learn progamming languages
is to learn multiple 
programming languages
and programming paradigms. 
</p>

<p>
The difficulty of learning the <em>n</em>th
language is half the difficulty of the (<em>n-1</em>)th.
</p>

<p>
Yet, to <em>truly</em> understand programming languages, one must implement one.

Ideally, every computer science major would take a compilers class.

At a minimum,  every computer science major should implement 
an interpreter.
</p>


<h3>Specific languages</h3>

<p>
The following languages provide a 
reasonable mixture of paradigms and practical applications:
</p>


<ul>
 <li>Racket;</li>
 <li>C;</li>
 <li>JavaScript;</li>
 <li>Squeak;</li>
 <li>Java;</li>
 <li>Standard ML;</li>
 <li>Prolog;</li>
 <li>Scala;</li>
 <li>Haskell;</li>
 <li>C++; and</li>
 <li>Assembly.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Racket</h4>

<p>
Racket, as a full-featured dialect of Lisp, has an aggressively simple syntax.
</p>

<p> For a small fraction of students, this syntax is an
impediment. 
</p>

<p>
To be blunt, if these students have a fundamental mental barrier
to accepting an alien syntactic regime even temporarily, they lack the mental dexterity to
survive a career in computer science.  </p>

<p>
Racket's powerful macro system and facilities for higher-order 
programming thoroughly erase the line between data and code.
</p>

<p>
If taught correctly, Lisp
liberates.
</p>

<h4>ANSI C</h4>

<p>
C is a terse and unforgiving abstraction of silicon.
</p>

<p>
C remains without rival in programming embedded systems.
</p>


<p> Learning C imparts a deep understanding of the dominant 
 von Neumann architecture in a way that no other language can.  </p>

<p> Given the intimate role poor C programming plays in the prevalence of the
buffer overflow security vulnerabilities, it is critical that programmers learn
how to program C properly.  </p>

<p> As the native language of the web, 
its pragmatic advantages are unique.</p>

<h4>Standard ML</h4>

<p>
Standard ML is a clean embodiment of the Hindley-Milner system.
</p>

<p> The Hindley-Milner type system is one of the greatest (yet least-known)
achievements in modern computing.  </p>


<p> Though exponential in complexity, type inference in Hindley-Milner is
always fast for programs of human interest.  </p>

<p> The type system is rich enough to allow the expression of 
complex structural invariants.

It is so rich, in fact, that well-typed programs
are often bug-free.  </p>

<h4>Prolog</h4>

<p>
Though niche in application, logic programming is an alternate
paradigm for computational thinking.
</p>

<p>
It's worth understanding logic programming for those instances
where a programmer may need to emulate it within another paradigm.
</p>

<p> Another logic language worth learning is <a
href="http://minikanren.org/">miniKanren</a>.  miniKanren stresses pure (cut
not allowed) logic programming.

This constraint has evolved an alternate style of logic programming called
relational programming, and it grants properties not typically enjoyed by
Prolog programs.

<h4>Scala</h4>

<p>
Scala is a well-designed fusion of functional and object-oriented 
programming languages.

Scala is what Java should have been.
</p>

<p> Built atop the Java Virtual Machine, it is compatible with existing Java
codebases, and as such, it stands out as the most likely successor to Java.
</p>

<h4>Assembly</h4>

<p>
Any assembly language will do.
</p>

<p>
Since x86 is popular, it might as well be that.
</p>

<p>
Learning compilers is the best way to learn assembly, since it 
gives the computer scientist an intuitive sense of how
high-level code will be transformed.
</p>



<h3>Specific recommendations</h3>

<p>
Computer scientists should understand 
generative programming (macros);
lexical (and dynamic) scope;
closures;
continuations;
higher-order functions;
dynamic dispatch;
subtyping; 
modules and functors;
and 
monads
as semantic concepts distinct from any specific syntax.

<h2>Discrete mathematics</h2>

<p> Computer scientists must have a solid grasp of formal logic and of proof.
Proof by algebraic manipulation and by natural deduction 
engages the reasoning common to routine programming tasks.
Proof by induction engages the reasoning used in the construction
of recursive functions.
</p>

<p> Computer scientists must be fluent in formal mathematical notation,
and in reasoning rigorously about the basic discrete structures: sets, tuples,
sequences, functions and power sets.</p>


<h3>Specific recommendations</h3>

<p> 
For computer scientists, it's important to cover reasoning about:</p>

<ul>
 <li>trees;</li>
 <li>graphs;</li>
 <li>formal languages; and</li>
 <li>automata.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Students should learn enough number theory to 
study and implement common cryptographic protocols.

<h2>Data structures and algorithms</h2>


<p>Students should certainly see the common (or rare yet unreasonably
effective) data structures and algorithms.  </p>

<p> But, more important than knowing a specific algorithm or data structure
(which is usually easy enough to look up), computer scientists must understand
how to design algorithms (e.g., greedy, dynamic strategies) and how to span the
gap between an algorithm in the ideal and the nitty-gritty of its
implementation.  </p>


<h3>Specific recommendations</h3>


<p> At a minimum, computer scientists seeking stable long-run employment
should know all of the following: </p>

<ul>
 <li>hash tables;</li>
 <li>linked lists;</li>
 <li>trees;</li>
 <li>binary search trees; and</li>
 <li>directed and undirected graphs.</li>
</ul>

<p> Computer scientists should be ready to implement or extend an
algorithm that operates on these data structures, including the ability to
search for an element, to add an element and to remove an element.
</p>

<p> For completeness, computer scientists should know both the imperative
and functional versions of each algorithm.  </p>

<h2>Theory</h2>

<p>
A grasp of theory is a prerequisite to research
in graduate school.
</p>

<p> Theory is invaluable when it provides hard boundaries on a problem (or when
it provides a means of circumventing what initially appear to be hard
boundaries).  </p>

<p> Computational complexity can legitimately claim to be one of the few truly
predictive theories in all of computer "science." 
</p>

<p>
A computer scientist <em>must</em> know where the 
boundaries of tractability and computability lie.
To ignore these limits invites frustration in the best case,
and failure in the worst.
</p>


<h3>Specific recommendations</h3>

<p>
At the undergraduate level, theory should cover at least
models of computation and computational complexity.
</p>


<p> Models of computation should cover finite-state automata, regular
languages (and regular expressions), pushdown automata, context-free languages, formal grammars,
Turing machines, the lambda calculus,
and undecidability. </p>

<p> At the undergraduate level, students should learn at least enough
complexity to understand the difference between P, NP, NP-Hard and NP-Complete.
</p>

<p>
To avoid leaving the wrong impression, students should solve a few large
problems in NP by reduction to SAT and the use of 
modern SAT solvers.
</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<p> There is no substitute for a solid understanding
of computer architecture.  </p>

<p>
Computer scientists should understand a computer 
from the transistors up.
</p>

<p> The understanding of architecture should encompass the
standard levels of abstraction: transistors, gates, adders, muxes, flip flops,
ALUs, control units, caches and RAM. </p>

<p> An understanding of the GPU model of high-performance computing
will be important for the foreseeable future.  </p>


<h3>Specific recommendations</h3>

<p> A good understanding of caches, buses and hardware memory management is
essential to achieving good performance on modern systems.  </p>

<p> To get a good grasp of machine architecture, students should design and
simulate a small CPU.  </p>

<h2>Operating systems</h2>

<p>
Any sufficiently large program eventually becomes
an operating system.
</p>

<p> As such, computer scientists should be aware of how kernels handle system
calls, paging, scheduling, context-switching, filesystems and internal resource
management.  </p>


<p> A good understanding of operating systems is secondary only to an
understanding of compilers and architecture for achieving performance.
</p>

<p> Understanding operating systems (which I would interpret liberally to
include runtime systems) becomes especially important when 
programming an embedded system without one.</p>



<h3>Specific recommendations</h3>

<p>
It's important for students to get their hands dirty on a real operating system.
With Linux and virtualization, this is easier than ever before.
</p>

<p>
To get a better understanding of the kernel,
students could:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>print "hello world" during the boot process;</li>
 <li>design their own scheduler;</li>
 <li>modify the page-handling policy; and</li>
 <li>create their own filesystem.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Networking</h2>

<p>
Given the ubiquity of networks, computer scientists should have a 
firm understanding of the network stack and 
routing protocols within a network.
</p>

<p>
The mechanics of building an efficient, reliable
transmission protocol (like TCP) on top of an unreliable
transmission protocol (like IP) 
should not be magic to a computer scientist.
It should be core knowledge.
</p>

<p> Computer scientists must understand the trade-offs involved in
protocol design--for example, when to choose TCP and when to choose UDP.

(Programmers need to understand the larger social implications for congestion should they use UDP at large scales as well.)
</p>



<h3>Specific recommendations</h3>

<p>
Given the frequency with which the modern programmer encounters
network programming, it's helpful to know the protocols for existing
standards, such as:
</p>

<ul>
 
  <li>802.3 and 802.11;</li>

  <li>IPv4 and IPv6; and</li>

  <li>DNS, SMTP and HTTP.</li>

</ul>

<p> Computer scientists should
understand exponential back off in packet collision resolution and the
additive-increase multiplicative-decrease mechanism involved in congestion
control.  </p>

<p>
Every computer scientist
should implement the following:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> an HTTP client and daemon;</li>
 <li> a DNS resolver and server; and</li>
 <li> a command-line SMTP mailer.</li>
</ul>


<p>
No student should ever pass an intro neworking class without
sniffing 
their instructor's Google query off <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/">wireshark</a>.
</p>

<p> It's probably going too far to require all students to implement a reliable
transmission protocol from scratch atop IP, but I can say that it was a
personally transformative experience for me as a student.  </p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>
The sad truth of security is that the majority 
of security vulnerabilities come from sloppy programming.

The sadder truth is that many schools do a poor job of 
training programmers to secure their code.
</p>

<p>
Computer scientists must be aware of the means by which
a program can be compromised.
</p>


<p> They need to develop a sense of defensive programming--a mind for thinking
about how their own code might be attacked.  </p>

<p>
Security is the kind of training that is best distributed throughout
the entire curriculum: each discipline should warn
students of its native vulnerabilities.
</p>


<h3>Specific recommendations</h3>

<p>
At a minimum, every computer scientist needs to
understand:
</p>

<ul>

 <li>
  social engineering;
 </li>

 <li>
  buffer overflows;
 </li>

 <li>
  integer overflow;
 </li>

 <li>
  code injection vulnerabilities; 
 </li>

 <li>
  race conditions; and
 </li>

 <li>
  privilege confusion. 
 </li>

</ul>


<p>
A few readers have pointed out that computer scientists
also need to be aware of basic IT security measures, 
such how to choose legitimately good passwords
and
how to properly configure a firewall with iptables.

<h2>Cryptography</h2>

<p>
Cryptography is what makes much of our digital lives possible.
</p>

<p> Computer scientists should understand and be able to implement the following
concepts, as well as the common pitfalls in doing so: </p>

<ul>
 <li>symmetric-key cryptosystems;</li>
 <li>public-key cryptosystems;</li>
 <li>secure hash functions;</li>
 <li>challenge-response authentication;</li>
 <li>digital signature algorithms; and</l>
 <li>threshold cryptosystems.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Since it's a common fault in implementations of cryptosystems,
every computer scientist should know how to acquire a 
<em>sufficiently</em> random number for the task at hand.
</p>

<p> At the very least, as nearly every data breach has shown,  
computer scientists need to know how to salt and hash passwords for storage.
</p>



<h3>Specific recommendations</h3>

<p> Every computer scientist should have the pleasure of breaking ciphertext
using pre-modern cryptosystems with hand-rolled statistical tools.  </p>


<p>
RSA is 
<a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/implementation-of-rsa-public-key-cryptography-algorithm-in-scheme-dialect-of-lisp/">easy enough to implement</a>
that everyone should do it.
</p>

<p>
Every student should create their own digital certificate
and set up https in apache.  (It's surprisingly arduous to do this.)
</p>

<p>
Student should also write a console web client that connects over SSL.
</p>


<p> As strictly practical matters, computer scientists 
should know how to use GPG; 
how to use public-key authentication for ssh;
and how to encrypt a directory or a hard disk.</p>

<h2>Software testing</h2>

<p>
Software testing must be distributed throughout the entire
curriculum.
</p>

<p>
A course on software engineering can cover the basic styles of testing,
but there's no substitute for practicing the art.
</p>

<p>
Students should be graded on the test cases they turn in.
</p>

<p>
I use test cases turned in by students against all other
students.
</p>

<p> Students don't seem to care much about developing defensive test cases, but
they unleash hell when it comes to sandbagging their classmates.  </p>


<h2>User experience design</h2>

<p>
Programmers too often write software for other 
programmers, or worse, for themselves.
</p>

<p>
User interface design (or more broadly, user experience design) 
might be the most underappreciated aspect of computer science.
</p>

<p> There's a misconception, even among professors, that user experience is a
"soft" skill that can't be taught.</p>

<p> In reality, modern user experience design is anchored in
empirically-wrought principles from human factors engineering
and industrial design.</p>

<p> If nothing else, computer scientists should know that interfaces need to
make the ease of executing any task proportional to the frequency of the task
multiplied by its importance.  </p>

<p>
As a practicality, every programmer should be comfortable with 
designing usable web interfaces in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

<h2>Visualization</h2>

<p>
Good visualization is about rendering data 
in such a fashion that
humans perceive it as information.
This is not an easy thing to do.
</p>

<p>
The modern world is a sea of data, and exploiting 
the 
local maxima of human
perception is key to making sense of it.
</p>

<h2>Parallelism</h2>

<p>
Parallelism is back, and uglier than ever.
</p>

<p>
The unfortunate truth is that harnessing parallelism
requires deep knowledge of architecture: multicore, caches, buses, GPUs, etc.
</p>

<p>
And, practice.  Lots of practice.
</p>


<h3>Specific recommendations</h3>

<p>
It is not at all clear what the "final" answer
on parallel programming is, but a few 
domain-specific solutions have emerged.
</p>

<p>
For now, students should learn CUDA and OpenCL.
</p>

<p> Threads are a flimsy abstraction for parallelism, particularly when caches
and cache coherency are involved.  But, threads are popular and tricky, so
worth learning.  Pthreads is a reasonably portable threads library to learn.</p>

<p> For anyone interested in large-scale parallelism, MPI is a
prerequisite.  </p>

<p>
On the principles side, it does seem that map-reduce is enduring.
</p>



<h2>Software engineering</h2>

<p>
The principles in software engineering change
about as fast as the programming languages do.
</p>

<p>
A good, hands-on course in the practice of team software construction
provides a working knowledge of the pitfalls inherent in the endeavor.
</p>

<p> It's been recommended by several readers that students break up into teams
of three, with the role of leader rotating through three different projects.
</p>

<p>
Learning how to attack and maneuver through a large existing
codebase is a skill most programmers will have to master,
and it's one best learned in school instead of on the job.
</p>


<h3>Specific recommendations</h3>

<p> All students need to understand centralized version control systems like
svn and distributed version control systems like git.  </p>

<p> A working knowlege of debugging tools
like gdb and valgrind goes a long way when they finally become necessary.  </p>

 Economics -- much of SE is informed by the ideas of (technically) superior tempered by the cost/benefit analysis that economics codifies.  Being able to estimate, perform trend analysis, and compute overhead can strongly affect success outcomes.

   Psychology -- their rigorous study of of (sensory) perception, intuition, and memory (chunking) applies strongly to HCI components of software design, but also code architecture and modularity [what is "one" thing in the sense of 'each module does one thing']

   Sociology -- bringing to bear the ideas of group dynamics, how to avoid group-think', understanding individual work styles (Meyers-Briggs) and environments (my desk is never clean, others have spotless offices every night; my office drives them insane and their OCD scares me :-)

<h2>Formal methods</h2>

<p>
As the demands on secure, reliable software increase, formal methods 
may one day end up as the only means for delivering it.
</p>

<p> At present, formal modeling and verification of software remains
challenging, but progress in the field is steady: it gets easier every
year.  </p>

<p>
There may even come a day within the lifetime of today's
computer science majors where formal software construction
is an expected skill.
</p>

<p>
Every computer scientist should be at least moderately comfortable
using one theorem prover.  (I don't think it matters which one.)
</p>


<p>
Learning to use a theorem prover immediately impacts coding style.
</p>

<p>
For example, one feels instinctively allergic to writing
a <code>match</code> or <code>switch</code> statement that 
doesn't cover all possibilities.
</p>

<p> And, when writing recursive functions, users of theorem provers 
have a strong urge to eliminate ill-foundedness.
</p>

<h2>Graphics and simulation</h2>


<p>
There is no discipline more dominated by "clever" 
than graphics.
</p>

<p>
The field is driven toward, even defined by, the "good enough."
</p>

<p>
As such, there is no better way to teach clever programming
or a solid appreciation of optimizing 
effort than graphics and simulation.
</p>

<p>
Over half of the coding hacks I've learned
came from my study of graphics.
</p>


<h3>Specific recommendations</h3>

<p> Simple ray tracers can be constructed in under 100
lines of code.  </p>

<p>
It's good mental hygiene to work out the transformations necessary 
to perform a perspective 3D projection in a wireframe 3D engine.
</p>

<p>
Data structures like BSP trees 
and algorithms like z-buffer rendering
are great examples of clever design.
</p>

<p>
In graphics and simulation, there are many more.
</p>

<h2>Robotics</h2>

<p>
Robotics may be one of the most engaging ways to teach
introductory programming.
</p>

<p> Moreover, as the cost of robotics continues to fall, thresholds are being
passed which will enable a personal robotics revolution.  </p>

<p>
For those that can program, unimaginable degrees of 
personal physical automation are on the horizon.

<h2>Artificial intelligence</h2>

<p> If for no other reason than its outsized impact on the early history of
computing, computer scientists should study artificial intelligence.
</p>

<p> While the original dream of intelligent machines seems far off, artificial
intelligence spurred a number of practical fields, such as machine learning,
data mining and natural language processing.  </p>

<h2>Machine learning</h2>


<p>
Aside from its outstanding technical merits,
the sheer number of job openings for "relevance engineer," 
indicates that every computer scientist should grasp
the fundamentals of machine learning.
</p>

<p> Machine learning doubly emphasizes the need for an understanding of
probability and statistics.  </p>


<h3>Specific recommendations</h3>

<p>
At the undergraduate level, core concepts 
should include Bayesian networks, 
clustering and decision-tree learning.

<h2>Databases</h2>

<p>
Databases are too common and too useful to ignore.
</p>

<p> It's useful to understand the fundamental data structures and algorithms
that power a database engine, since programmers often enough reimplement a
database system within a larger software system.  </p>

<p> Relational algebra and relational calculus stand out as 
exceptional success stories in sub-Turing models of computation.  </p>

<p> Unlike UML modeling, ER modeling seems to be a reasonable mechanism for
visualing encoding the design of and constraints upon a software artifact.
</p>
